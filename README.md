# Let's Meet

This is a project using Google Maps to let people meet up with strangers on-the-go.

## Values and Goals

     - Increased social cohesion and integration
        - Studies show that we are increasingly lonely. In cultures characterized by individualism, support and interaction with family and community tends to weaken.
        - It can be difficult to meet new people outside of the workplace or our existing social circles. Additionally, these circles tend to be homogeneous, leading to people clustering together. Birds of a feather flock together.

    - Anti-matchmaking
        - The apps out on the market focus on connecting people based upon profiles. This leads to a brandification of users, making their social media persona increasingly important for real-life status.
        - A cure for this is to forgoe profiles as much as possible, instead using randomness to connect people.
        - This randomness would lead to socializing beyond our natural comfort zone, breaking down barriers of age and class.

## Revenue streams

    - The likelihood of certain places being suggested as meeting spots could be increased as a service to business owners.
